## Usage

### Setup/Installation

[Download the repo as a zip file](https://github.com/jsoma/sample-node-project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it. Then install the necessary dependencies.

```
npm install
```

### Development server

The dev server automatically uses `src/index.html` as the Parcel entry point.

```
npm run dev
```

### Building out the website

```
npm run build
```

The website is built into the `docs` folder. You can change this by editing `package.json`.
